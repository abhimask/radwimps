<h3>Famous works</h3>
<p>Japan's Radwimps plied a technical, angular, often abrasive brand of indie rock with emotive, literate lyrics, 
    which brought them huge chart success in their own country, and respectable sales overseas, despite none of their
     albums ever being officially released outside of Japan. Following their eponymous 2003 debut, the group broke into the Japanese 
     mainstream with third effort Mujinto ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai, their first platinum-certified set. From there, each platinum release 
     climbed further up the charts until they started a number one chart-run in 2016 with Your Name, the soundtrack to the anime of the same name.</p>

                <h3>Music Setup</h3>
                <p>Lead vocalist Yojiro Noda writes all of the band's music and lyrics (the only exception currently is the bonus track "Yonaki" from Radwimps 4, 
                    written by Akira Kuwahara). Almost all of Noda's lyrics are based on events he experienced, or non-fictional events. "Enren" from Radwimps 
                    4: Okazu no Gohan, released in 2006, was the first time Noda has written a fictional song since the band formed. He personally finds lyric w
                    riting a chore, as while he writes lyrics, he constantly questions each phrase, asking if that was exactly what he wanted to say.</p>

<h1 class="text-center">Meet the Artists</h1>
<p class="text-center">The band's name, Radwimps, 
    was formed from two English language slang terms, "rad" and "wimp".<br>
    According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, 
    including "excellent weakling" and "superlative coward".</p>

                <p class="review"> We released 2 albums last year and with the huge success of the movie “Your Name.”, a lot of people got to know us for the first time.
                     It was a very fruitful year for the band.
                     This year, we will be doing a lot of shows so looking forward to that.

                <p class="review"> Noda's solo project, Illion, was first announced in November 2012. He began the solo career in order to perform overseas, 
                    which is a goal his band, Radwimps, did not share.
                     His debut album, Ubu, was released in Japan and Europe, first on February 25, 2013, in the United Kingdom.

                <p class="review"> Putting that aside … "Zenzenzense" was originally recorded in the version of Your Name's movie soundtrack,
                    but during the movie production process, we’ve decided to add lyrics to it. We all loved the lyrics and wanted to properly record another version.
